# The Farmer Was Replaced

A fantastic little game about harvesting different plants using a farming drone. You control the drone with statements and write code to solve new problems and develop strategies to farm products. The language used is very similar to, if not exactly, Python. Slowly introduces new concepts, and is good for both beginners and experienced programmers.

This is my collection of functions that I use in the game so far. Will update with what I create in the future.
